                      Instawork created, develops, and maintains an online
                      software and mobile application platform on which Partners
                      connect with Professionals to fill one-time and/or
                      recurring work opportunities. Our Services enable
                      Professionals and other potential users of our Services to
                      communicate their contact information, work experience,
                      and reference information directly to Partners seeking to
                      fill open work opportunities, in a format that these
                      Partners understand. Our Services also enable eligible
                      Professionals to find temporary work as contractors (or in
                      some cases, where specified, employees) and we facilitate
                      that matching process. For contractors, we also facilitate
                      payment to Professionals for that work. Our Services also
                      enable Partners to communicate “Partner Requests” (a
                      request for Professional(s) to fill worker opportunities
                      posted by a Partner through the Services) and the criteria
                      they are using to match with a Professional; this matching
                      turns an “Open Partner Request” (a Partner Request that
                      has not been accepted by a Professional) into a “Partner
                      Engagement” (a Partner Request that a Professional has
                      accepted and for which the Professional has agreed to
                      perform services for the Partner). Our Services also
                      enable Professionals and users to directly connect the
                      people who will be their professional references to
                      Partners. As a Professional, You choose Your references
                      (we call them “References”), and You can see what they say
                      about You (and ask us to remove comments with which You do
                      not agree). Once You’ve completed a Partner Engagement
                      with a Partner, that Partner can leave feedback that’s
                      visible to You and other Partners that use Instawork. If
                      You do not agree with the feedback, You can let us know
                      and we will review and potentially remove it. Our Services
                      strive to make the information given to us by
                      Professionals (and their References), Partners, and users
                      available in the most relevant and efficient way, so that
                      Professionals and users can find the work opportunities
                      they want and Partners can find the workers they need.

                      of work for a Partner (in the case of a Professional)
                      creates a direct business relationship between Partner and
                      Professional. Once services have been rendered by a
                      Professional, Instawork facilitates payment of applicable
                      fees by the Partner to the Professional, but Instawork is
                      neither the beneficiary of the work, nor does it undertake
                      any responsibility for the nature or amount of payment for

                          proceedings, such as court reporter costs and
                          transcript fees. We shall pay any costs that are
                          uniquely associated with arbitration, such as payment
                          of the arbitrator and room rental; (2) If a Party
                          timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule
                          of Civil Procedure 68, or any other state-law
                          equivalent, and the judgment that the other Party
                          finally obtains is not more favorable than the
                          unaccepted offer, then the other Party shall pay the
                          costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer
                          was made; (3) Both Parties agree not to oppose or
                          interfere with any negotiations or agreements between
                          the other Party and the arbitration administrator, or

                          of the fees. The arbitrator, however, may disallow any
                          private agreement between an administrator, on the one
                          hand, and the negotiating party, on the other hand, if
                          the arbitrator believes that the private agreement
                          undermines his or her neutrality as arbitrator; (4)

                          discovery sufficient to allow each Party to prepare
                          that Party’s claims and/or defenses, taking into
                          consideration that arbitration is designed to be a
                          speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes;
                          (5) Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver and
                          Representative Action Waiver, the arbitrator may award
                          all remedies to which a Party is entitled under
                          applicable law and which would otherwise be available

                          imposition of sanctions under the Federal Rules of
                          Civil Procedure, but shall not be empowered to award
                          any remedies that would not have been available in a
                          court of law for the claims presented in arbitration.
                          The arbitrator shall apply the state or federal
                          substantive law, or both, as is applicable; (6) The
                          arbitrator may hear motions to dismiss and/or motions
                          for summary judgment. An arbitrator may not permit the
                          filing of a motion for summary judgment until after
                          the Parties have conducted discovery to support their
                          claims and defenses. Any motion to dismiss and/or
                          motion for summary judgment shall otherwise be
                          governed by the standards of the Federal Rules of
                          Civil Procedure governing such motions; (7) The
                          arbitrator’s decision or award shall be in writing
                          with findings of fact and conclusions of law; (8) Any
                          finding that a claim or counterclaim was filed for
                          purposes of harassment or is frivolous shall entitle
                          the other Party to recover its, his, or her attorneys’
                          fees, costs, and expenses; (9) Either We or You may
                          apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
                          temporary or preliminary injunctive relief on the
                          ground that without such relief the arbitration
                          provided in this Section 11 may be rendered
                          ineffectual; and (10) The arbitrator may consider, but
                          under no circumstances is the arbitrator bound by,
                          decisions reached in separate arbitrations. If at any
                          time the arbitrator or arbitration administrator fails
                          to enforce the terms of this Mutual Arbitration
                          Provision, either Party may seek to enjoin the
                          arbitration proceeding in a court of competent
                          jurisdiction, and the arbitration shall automatically
                          be stayed pending the outcome of that proceeding.
